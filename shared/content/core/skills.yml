Battle Fury:
  text: >
    When you **fling yourself into a fury of weapon, tooth, and claw in an all-out attack at intimate range**, mark wear on your weapon and roll with Luck. On a hit, fill your exhaustion track. For each box you mark, inflict 2-injury on your target. On a 7-9, your target also inflicts their harm upon you. This move does not require the weapon to be tagged with intimate range; weapons with close range may also be used.

    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - intimate
    - close

Charge:
  text: >
    When you **charge at an opponent at far range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, they must choose to either mark 2-exhaustion or allow you to push them—you say where they are driven, and you say what range you now stand at. On a 10+, inflict morale harm on them as well.

    - weapon

  allowRange:
    - intimate
    - close

Cleave:
  text: >
    When you **cleave armored foes at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, you smash through their defenses and equipment; inflict 3-wear. On a 7-9, you overextend your weapon or yourself: mark wear or end up in a bad spot, your choice.

  mastery: On a 12+, you inflict 6-wear instead. Any excess wear instead becomes injury or exhaustion (your choice) dealt to your foes.

  allowRange:
    - close

Confuse Senses:
  text: When you **throw something to confuse an opponent's senses at close or intimate range**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you've thrown them off balance, blinded them, deafened them, or confused them, and given yourself an opportunity. On a 10+, they have to take some time to get their bearings and restore their senses before they can act clearly again. On a 7-9, you have just a few moments.

  mastery: >
    On a 12+, choose one:


    * you successfully confuse the senses of a whole group; apply the results of the 10+ move to any foes you choose in range

    * you knock a single foe so off-kilter you can take them out exactly as you choose right now, without triggering any move

Disarm:
  text: When you target an opponent's weapon with your strikes at close range, roll with Finesse. On a hit, they have to mark 2-exhaustion or lose their weapon—it's well out of reach. On a 10+, they have to mark 3-exhaustion instead of 2.

  mastery: On a 12+, your opponent both marks 3-exhaustion and loses their weapon.

Hammerpaws:
  text: >
    When you **come to blows with an armed opponent at close or intimate range while you are unarmed**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, they inflict their harm on you. On a 7-9, choose 2. On a 10+, choose 3.


    * you inflict 2-exhaustion on your opponent

    * you shift your range one step

    * you deflect some of their incoming blows; suffer little (-1) harm

    * you inflict wear on their equipment with precise strikes

    * you take an object from them; they must mark exhaustion to stop you

  allowItem: []
  allowRange:
    - close

Harry:
  text: >
    When you **harry a group of enemies at far range**, mark wear and roll with Cunning. On a 10+, both. On a 7-9, choose 1:


    * inflict 2-morale harm

    * they are pinned or blocked

  mastery: On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, you inflict an additional 2-injury or 2-morale, your choice.

  allowItem:
    - Bow
    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - far

Hurl:
  text: >
    When you **hurl a weapon or dangerous object not intended for throwing at an enemy at far range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, your hurled weapon strikes your target; mark wear on the weapon and inflict 1-injury and 1-exhaustion on your target. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.


    * mark an additional wear on the hurled item to inflict an additional
    1-injury

    * the hurled item rebounds to somewhere reachable, instead of out of
    sight or out of reach

    * your target is knocked off their feet by the throw

  allowItem:
    - Bow
    - Weapon

Improvise Weapon:
  text: >
    When you **make a weapon out of improvised materials around you**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you make a weapon; the GM will tell you its range tag and at least one other tag based on the materials you used. On a 7-9, the weapon also has a weakness tag.

  mastery: On a 12+, you may choose your weapon’s range and two beneficial tags it bears (as long as they make sense to the item).

  allowItem: []
  allowRange: []

Long Shot:
  text: >
    When you **pull hard on your bow's draw to extend its range beyond far**, mark wear and exhaustion to roll any far range weapon move (**target someone**, **pinpoint shot**, etc.) with Might instead of the move's normal stat, paying the additional cost(s) of the weapon move as well. **This weapon skill requires your weapon to be tagged with far range, this skill, and the tag for whatever weapon move you are using (if needed).**

  allowItem:
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - far

Lunge:
  text: >
    When you **make an outright lunge at a foe within close range**, choose an amount of injury between 1-injury and 3-injury and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you inflict that amount of injury—ignoring armor—but if your target survives (or if other foes are present) they can take advantage of your over-extension to inflict the same amount on you. On a 7-9, they can inflict 1-injury more upon you than you had originally chosen to inflict upon them.

  allowItem:
    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - close

Paired Fighting:
  text: >
    When you and another vagabond **pair fight back to back against foes at close range**, you each mark exhaustion and one of you rolls with the following modifiers (max +3):


    * +1 if you have a connection with each other

    * +1 if you are outnumbered

    * +1 for every 2 additional exhaustion you mark between the two of you


    On a hit, you together inflict 1-injury on every foe within close range (or
    3-injury total against a group), and you each suffer 1-injury. On a 7-9,
    choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.


    * you each suffer little (-1) harm

    * you inflict an additional 2-injury to any single target (including a single group) of your choice

    * you inflict 2-morale harm

    * you create a path for the two of you to retreat or advance

  allowItem:
    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - close

Parry:
  text: >
    When you **try to parry the attacks of an enemy at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you consume their attention. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 1.


    * you inflict morale or exhaustion (GM's choice)

    * you disarm your opponent; their weapon is out of hand, but in reach

    * you don't suffer any harm

  mastery: >
    On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, you can immediately riposte, choosing one:


    * you inflict 2-injury with a strike that pierces their defenses; they cannot absorb the injury with armor

    * you inflict 2-morale with an insulting line or gesture that demeans them

    * you inflict 2-exhaustion with a quick punch or blow intended to disorient and knock them out

  allowItem:
    - Weapon
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - close

Pinpoint Shot:
  text: >
    When you **take the time to fire a shot at far range with pinpoint accuracy**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you put the shot exactly where you choose:


    * if you target an NPC's weak point, inflict 3-injury (unblockable by armor)

    * if you target a piece of equipment's weak point, inflict 2-wear

    * if you target something in the environment, you strike it, cut it, or break it as appropriate


    On a 7-9, your current vantage point isn't quite right; you need to move to a better one before you can make the perfect shot. Mark exhaustion to scramble there, and then choose as normal.

  allowItem:
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - far

Point-Blank Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a shot at point-blank range (intimate range)**, mark any combination of up to 2-wear and up to 2-exhaustion, and roll with Luck. On a hit, you put your shot into your target; inflict injury equivalent to the wear and exhaustion you marked, combined. On a 10+, you can also skip back after your shot, moving to close range before your opponent can grab you or otherwise retaliate. **Your weapon does not need to be tagged with intimate range to use this weapon skill.**

  allowItem:
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - intimate
    - close
    - far

Quick Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a snap shot at an enemy at close range**, roll with Luck. On a hit, inflict injury. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.


    * you don't mark wear

    * you don't mark exhaustion

    * you move quickly and change your position (and, if you choose, range)

    * you keep your target at bay—they don't move

  mastery: On a 12+, take all four options from the list and inflict 2-injury instead of 1-injury.

  allowItem:
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - close

Storm a Group:
  text: >
    When you storm a group of foes in melee, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, trade harm. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.


    * you show them up; you inflict 2-morale

    * you keep them off balance and confused; you inflict 2-exhaustion

    * you avoid their blows to the best of your ability; you suffer little (-1) harm.

    * you use them against each other; mark exhaustion again and they inflict their harm against themselves

  mastery: On a 12+, take all four options from the list and choose one for double effect.

  allowItem:
    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - close

Switch Hands:
  text: >
    When you shift your grip to change your dominant hand in the middle of an extended bout with a foe, roll with Finesse. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2:


    * your new dominant hand is fresher; clear 2-exhaustion

    * your opponent is startled by the shift; they mark morale harm

    * your shift gives you an immediate opportunity; mark exhaustion to seize it and inflict 2-injury

  allowItem:
    - Bow
    - Weapon

  allowRange:
    - intimate
    - close
    - far

Trick Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a clever shot designed to take advantage of the environment**, mark wear and roll with Finesse. On a 7-9, choose 2. On a 10+, choose 3.


    * your shot lands in any target of your choice within range, even if it's behind cover or hidden (inflicting injury or wear if appropriate)

    * your shot strikes a second available target of your choice

    * your shot cuts something, breaks something, or knocks something over, your choice

    * your shot distracts an opponent and provides an opportunity

  allowItem:
    - Bow

  allowRange:
    - far
    - close
    - intimate

Vicious Strike:
  text: >
    When you **viciously strike an opponent where they are weak at intimate or close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, they suffer serious (+1) harm and cannot mark wear on their armor to block it. On a 10+, you get away with the strike. On a 7-9, they score a blow against you as well.

  mastery: >
    On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, you strike them so well you incapacitate them, choosing one from the list:


    * they cannot change position—fleeing, advancing, maneuvering, etc.— until they receive medical aid

    * they cannot wield a weapon until they receive medical aid

    * they cannot communicate until they receive medical aid

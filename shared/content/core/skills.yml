Blind:
  text: When you **throw something to blind an opponent**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you've impaired their vision and given yourself an opportunity. On a 10+, they have to take some time to clean out their eyes before they can see clearly again. On a 7–9, you have just a few moments.

Cleave:
  text: >
    When you **cleave armored foes at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, you smash through their defenses and equipment; inflict 3-decay. On a 7–9, you overextend your weapon or yourself: mark decay or end up in a bad spot, your choice.

Confuse Senses:
  text: No description.

Disarm:
  text: When you **target an opponent's weapon with your strikes**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, they have to mark two exhaustion or drop their weapon. On a 10+, they have to mark three exhaustion instead of two.

Harry:
  text: >
    When you harry a group of enemies at far range, mark decay and roll with Cunning. On a 10+, both. On a 7–9, choose 1:


    * They suffer morale harm.
    
    * They are pinned or blocked.

Improvise:
  text: >
    When you **make a weapon out of improvised materials around you**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you make a weapon; the GM will tell you its range tag and at least one other tag based on the materials you used. On a 7–9, the weapon also has a weakness tag.


Parry:
  text: >
    When you **try to parry the attacks of an enemy at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you consume their attention. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7–9, pick 1.


    * You inflict morale harm on them.

    * You disarm your opponent.

    * You don't suffer any harm.

Quick Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a snap shot at an enemy at close range**, roll with Luck. On a hit, inflict injury. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.


    * You don't mark decay.

    * You don't mark exhaustion.

    * You move quickly and change your position (and, if you choose, range).

    * You keep your target at bay — they don't move.

Storm a Group:

Trick Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a clever shot designed to take advantage of the environment**, mark decay on your bow and roll with Finesse. On a 7–9, choose 2. On a 10+, choose 3.


    * Your shot lands in any target of your choice within range, even if it's behind cover or hidden (inflicting injury or decay if appropriate).

    * Your shot strikes a second available target of your choice.

    * Your shot cuts something, breaks something, or knocks something over, your choice.

    * Your shot distracts an opponent and provides an opportunity.

Vicious Strike:
  text: >
    When you viciously strike an opponent where they are weak, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, they suffer serious harm. On a 10+, you get away with the strike. On a 7–9, they get a shot in as well.

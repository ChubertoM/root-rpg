The Worth of a Book:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **study your tomes and scrolls to discover old techniques or methods** to solve an intractable problem—curing a deadly disease, ending a drought, legally unseating a leader, etc—decide what you want to change and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to discover a path forward, including time taken, additional information needed, mentors or translators needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits of your solution. When you fulfill the conditions, you gain whatever knowledge you were seeking—it's up to you to put to use.

On a hit, you discover evidence of their secrets; the GM will tell you who would pay for the information you've uncovered.

On a miss, your search yields terrible news—someone is acting against you or your interests in an unexpected arena.

Loremaster:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **consult your knowledge in order to understand a political conflict**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, the GM tells you what information you remember that completes your understanding of the messy situation. On a 10+, you can ask a followup question; the GM will answer honestly.

Good Advice:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **offer an NPC advice about a sticky situation**, offer them the best advice you've got and roll with cunning. On a hit, they see the wisdom of your suggestion; they have to mark exhaustion or incorporate your advice into their plans. On a 7-9, you let something about your own plans or allegiances slip as you try to help them out. On a miss, the advice angers or offends them; the GM will tell you what local custom you've overstepped with your meddling.

# Exile

    * If they merely know you by your former reputation, take a +1.

    * If you have worked closely with them before, take a +2.

    * If they were a close friend or loyal servitor, take a +3.


    On a hit, your exile has done little to diminish their respect for you; they offer you whatever comfort and aid they can, even to the point of risking their own reputation and safety. On a 7-9, they can only assist you if they can cover their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction as you added to your roll as they spread a story of the terrible treatment they endured when they met you. On a miss, your attempts to contact your old network only reveal your position and desperation; mark as much notoriety as you added to your roll and those who hunt you will surely be here soon.

    On a miss, someone powerful takes offense at your plunder of local sites.

Loremaster:
  archetype: The Seeker
  text: When you **try to convince a powerful NPC to supply an exploratory adventure**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, they give you 8-value in resources and depletion—but you must fulfill a request. On a 10+, they ask for something general—more riches, information, a prize or trophy. On a 7-9, they want something specific—a singular treasure, secret knowledge, a lost ritual. On a miss, they mount a competing expedition based on what you have told them.

Watch the Signs:
  archetype: The Seeker
  text: >
    When you first attune yourself to a ruin or mysterious site by taking in its signs, symbols, particular traits, and layout, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2.

Danger Mask:
  archetype: The Scoundrel
  text: You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of "the real you," than a disguise.

    Blessings (choose 2):


    * stocked: your ship gains a 2-box depletion track of cargo and gear

    * nimble: take +1 ongoing to tricking NPCs when relying on your ship's speed

    * renowned: take +1 to reputation with a faction (your choice) while on your ship

    * swift: once per session, mark wear to outrun any pursuer


    Flaws (choose 2):


    * dreaded: take +1 to reputation with a faction (your choice) while on your ship

    * rickety: your ship has one fewer box of wear

    * clumsy: take -1 ongoing to trusting fate when piloting your ship carefully

    * stolen: someone dangerous is pursuing you to recover their property

Sail On:
  archetype: The Pirate
  text: When you **travel from clearing to clearing by ship**, mark wear on the ship and roll with Luck. On a hit, you reach the next port; the GM will tell you one friendly denizen you know there. On a 7-9, they are holding a grudge—work it out or offer at least 2-value to let things go. On a miss, you are caught in a dangerous situation along your route before you arrive at port.

Swashbuckler:
  archetype: The Pirate
  text: When you first charge into battle by swinging, diving, or leaping to **engage an enemy in melee at close range**, roll with Luck instead of Might.

X Marks the Spot:
  archetype: The Pirate
  text: When you try to recall the location of buried treasure in your clearing, roll with Luck. On a hit, you remember one such cache. On a 7-9, the location is accessible or private, your choice. On a 10+, both. On a miss, you remember the location, but it is guarded, difficult to reach, and very public.

Plenty of Rum:
  archetype: The Pirate
  text: Once per session, you may **plead with a vagabond** a second time in a session by sharing your rum (mark depletion) with the target of your pleading.

Sea Legs:
  archetype: The Pirate
  text: When you **attempt a roguish feat** to sneak, hide, or perform acrobatics, roll with Luck instead of Finesse.

# Raider
Eye For Battle:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: When you **read a tense situation** just as violence breaks out, roll with Might instead of Cunning.

Ironhide:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: Once per session, you can **mark exhaustion to ignore a blow that would usually inflict injury upon you**. You cannot mark exhaustion to avoid injury so long as you could mark wear on your armor to avoid the injury instead.

Loot and Plunder:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: >
    When you **loot a rich area for valuables**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, something out of the ordinary catches your eye; claim it and it's yours. On a 10+ all 3. on a 7-9 choose 1:


    * It is worth a lot of money (+2-value)

    * It is of special value to a particular faction (+4 prestige if traded to them)

    * It is extremely durable (+1-wear)


    On a miss, you can get your hands on it, but it is sought by dangerous denizens who are all too willing to kill to take it from whoever possesses it.

Merciful Might:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: When you **try to befriend an NPC you've saved from the wrath of another**, spend time helping them further (mark exhaustion) or buy them a drink (mark depletion). Your continued kindness pays dividends; they'll share a valuable secret or grant you a serious favor.

Plan of Attack:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: >
    When you **work out a plan of attack with someone**, roll with Might. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. You can spend your hold 1-for-1, regardless of distance, while the plan is being carried out to:


    * Lend a hand; add +1 to someone's roll (choose after rolling)

    * Soften a blow; reduce by one the harm someone suffers from a single attack

    * Ensure your gear holds; allow someone to ignore marking depletion


    On a miss, hold 1, but your plan encounters some disastrous opposition right from the start.

Fearsome Visage:
  archetype: The Raider
  text: You can **make a pointed threat** or **publicly draw attention to yourself** as an enemy of a faction when you have a Reputation of 0 or lower with that faction, not just the usual -3 or -2 reputation required. Remember, you roll as if your negative reputation was positive, so a -1 Reputation becomes a +1 for the roll and a 0 remains a 0.

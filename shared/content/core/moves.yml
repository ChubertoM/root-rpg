The Worth of a Book:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **study your tomes and scrolls to discover old techniques or methods** to solve an intractable problem—curing a deadly disease, ending a drought, legally unseating a leader, etc—decide what you want to change and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to discover a path forward, including time taken, additional information needed, mentors or translators needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits of your solution. When you fulfill the conditions, you gain whatever knowledge you were seeking—it's up to you to put to use.

An Eye for the Real Story:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **read a tense situation**, mark an exhaustion—even on a miss—to spot a fellow observer who knows more than you might expect. Take a +1 ongoing to convince them to share their secrets with you when you get them in private.

Search the Records:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **examine the documents, records, or assorted notes of an important NPC (your call)**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you discover evidence of their secrets; the GM will tell you who would pay for the information you've uncovered. On a 10+, you also take a 12+ instead of rolling the next time you try to figure them out. On a miss, your search yields terrible news—someone is acting against you or your interests in an unexpected arena.

Loremaster:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **consult your knowledge in order to understand a political conflict**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, the GM tells you what information you remember that completes your understanding of the messy situation. On a 10+, you can ask a followup question; the GM will answer honestly. On a miss, something about the situation doesn't fit the history—the GM will tell you what has radically shifted.

Good Advice:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **offer an NPC advice about a sticky situation**, offer them the best advice you've got and roll with cunning. On a hit, they see the wisdom of your suggestion; they have to mark exhaustion or incorporate your advice into their plans. On a 7-9, you let something about your own plans or allegiances slip as you try to help them out. On a miss, the advice angers or offends them; the GM will tell you what local custom you've overstepped with your meddling.

# Exile
Known by All:
  archetype: The Exile
  text: >
    When you **first encounter an important NPC from the faction that exiled you**, you may declare them an old ally—choosing one from the list below instead of meeting someone important—and roll.


    * If they merely know you by your former reputation, take a +1.

    * If you have worked closely with them before, take a +2.

    * If they were a close friend or loyal servitor, take a +3.


    On a hit, your exile has done little to diminish their respect for you; they offer you whatever comfort and aid they can, even to the point of risking their own reputation and safety. On a 7-9, they can only assist you if they can cover their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction as you added to your roll as they spread a story of the terrible treatment they endured when they met you. On a miss, your attempts to contact your old network only reveal your position and desperation; mark as much notoriety as you added to your roll and those who hunt you will surely be here soon.

I Bring You...:

# Seeker
Word on the Street:

On a hit, you catch wind of a nearby unexplored wonder or ruin; someone promises to take you to it for a fair fee (1-value).

  text: When you **try to convince a powerful NPC to supply an exploratory adventure**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, they give you 8-value in resources and depletion—but you must fulfill a request.

On a miss, they mount a competing expedition based on what you have told them.

Watch the Signs:
  archetype: The Seeker
  text: >
    When you first attune yourself to a ruin or mysterious site by taking in its signs, symbols, particular traits, and layout, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. On a miss, you may mark an exhaustion to hold 1. While within that ruin or mysterious site, you can spend your hold 1 for 1 to:


    * Identify the quickest path to the closest valuable treasure or knowledge.
    
    * Disarm a trap or overcome a natural hazard without cost.

    * Name a character within reach about to suffer harm; you suffer it instead.

Strong Draw:

    You have expertise in the poisons and antidotes of the Woodland. When you brew a poison, mark depletion and say what effect you want it to have: sleep, weakness, inebriation, or death.

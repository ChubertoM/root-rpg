The Worth of a Book:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **study your tomes and scrolls to discover old techniques or methods** to solve an intractable problem—curing a deadly disease, ending a drought, legally unseating a leader, etc—decide what you want to change and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to discover a path forward, including time taken, additional information needed, mentors or translators needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits of your solution. When you fulfill the conditions, you gain whatever knowledge you were seeking—it's up to you to put to use.

On a hit, you discover evidence of their secrets; the GM will tell you who would pay for the information you've uncovered.

On a miss, your search yields terrible news—someone is acting against you or your interests in an unexpected arena.

Loremaster:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **consult your knowledge in order to understand a political conflict**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, the GM tells you what information you remember that completes your understanding of the messy situation. On a 10+, you can ask a followup question; the GM will answer honestly. On a miss, something about the situation doesn't fit the history—the GM will tell you what has radically shifted.

Good Advice:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **offer an NPC advice about a sticky situation**, offer them the best advice you've got and roll with cunning. On a hit, they see the wisdom of your suggestion; they have to mark exhaustion or incorporate your advice into their plans.

# Exile
Known by All:
  archetype: The Exile
  text: >
    When you **first encounter an important NPC from the faction that exiled you**, you may declare them an old ally—choosing one from the list below instead of meeting someone important—and roll.


    * If they merely know you by your former reputation, take a +1.

    * If you have worked closely with them before, take a +2.

    * If they were a close friend or loyal servitor, take a +3.


    On a hit, your exile has done little to diminish their respect for you; they offer you whatever comfort and aid they can, even to the point of risking their own reputation and safety. On a 7-9, they can only assist you if they can cover their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction as you added to your roll as they spread a story of the terrible treatment they endured when they met you. On a miss, your attempts to contact your old network only reveal your position and desperation; mark as much notoriety as you added to your roll and those who hunt you will surely be here soon.

  text: When you **spend time in a clearing talking with locals**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you catch wind of a nearby unexplored wonder or ruin; someone promises to take you to it for a fair fee (1-value).

On a miss, they mount a competing expedition based on what you have told them.

Watch the Signs:
  archetype: The Seeker
  text: >
    When you first attune yourself to a ruin or mysterious site by taking in its signs, symbols, particular traits, and layout, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2.

When you dive into a dangerous situation without forethought or planning, treat yourself as having "Luck Armor," with 1 box of wear (remember, armor is only "destroyed" when you would mark another box of wear, and all its boxes are full).

Danger Mask:
  archetype: The Scoundrel
  text: You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of "the real you," than a disguise.

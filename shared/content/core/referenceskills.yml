    When you **grapple with an enemy at intimate range**, roll with Might. On a hit, you choose simultaneously. Continue making choices until someone disengages, falls unconscious, or dies. On a 10+, you make one choice first, before beginning to make simultaneous choices.


    * you strike a fast blow; inflict injury

    * you wear them down; they mark exhaustion

    * you exploit weakness; mark exhaustion to inflict 2-injury

    * you withdraw; disengage to close range

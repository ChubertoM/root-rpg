      When you **first encounter an important NPC from the faction that exiled you**, you may declare them an old ally—choosing one from the list below instead of meeting someone important—and roll.


      * If they merely know you by your former reputation, take a +1.
      * If you have worked closely with them before, take a +2.
      * If they were a close friend or loyal servitor, take a +3.


      On a hit, your exile has done little to diminish their respect for you; they offer you whatever comfort and aid they can, even to the point of risking their own reputation and safety. On a 7-9, they can only assist you if they can cover their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction as you added to your roll as they spread a story of the terrible treatment they endured when they met you. On a miss, your attempts to contact your old network only reveal your position and desperation; mark as much notoriety as you added to your roll and those who hunt you will surely be here soon.

    text: When you **trick an NPC** into granting you access or information by pretending to be a high-ranking member of their faction, roll with Charm instead of Cunning.

When you deliver a vital resource or prisoner to a faction, you may **ask for a favor** from the faction as if you rolled a 12+. If your reputation with that faction is already +2 or greater, you may instead **sway the NPC** whose cause you most directly benefited with your contribution as if you rolled a 12+.

  - name: Greatest of the Age
    text: When you engage an enemy in melee, you take all four options and one for double effect when you roll a 12+.

  - name: Fancy Paper
    text: You gain the roguish feat Counterfeit (it does not count against your maximum for advancement).

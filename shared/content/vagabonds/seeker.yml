    text: When you **spend time in a clearing talking with locals**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you catch wind of a nearby unexplored wonder or ruin; someone promises to take you to it for a fair fee (1-value). On a 7-9, the dangers make their price steeper—an additional 1-value of coin or gear. On a miss, the location is under threat—soon it will be plundered, destroyed, or claimed by another power

      When you sell the **treasures you found in a ruin at market**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you find some buyers. On a 7-9, take 1. On a 10+, both:


      * you get a good price; you get double what such findings are usually worth
      * you are popular; mark two prestige with the controlling faction


      On a miss, someone powerful takes offense at your plunder of local sites.

    text: When you **try to convince a powerful NPC to supply an exploratory adventure**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, they give you 8-value in resources and depletion—but you must fulfill a request. On a 10+, they ask for something general—more riches, information, a prize or trophy. On a 7-9, they want something specific—a singular treasure, secret knowledge, a lost ritual. On a miss, they mount a competing expedition based on what you have told them.

      When you first attune yourself to a ruin or mysterious site by taking in its signs, symbols, particular traits, and layout, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. On a miss, you may mark an exhaustion to hold 1. While within that ruin or mysterious site, you can spend your hold 1 for 1 to:


      * Identify the quickest path to the closest valuable treasure or knowledge.
      * Disarm a trap or overcome a natural hazard without cost.
      * Name a character within reach about to suffer harm; you suffer it instead.
      * Name a character in the ruin; you cross the distance to them instantly.
      * Take cover in the ruin; ignore all harm from a single attack or catastrophe

    text: When you use a rough or chaotic environment—slippery rocks, a crowded market, etc—to gain an advantage over your opponents in a fight, you can mark exhaustion to **grapple** with them using Finesse instead of Might.
